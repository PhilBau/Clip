Some things you should know for using pagemaster:

workflow: "none"
- all users can add new publications to the publicaiton type 
  if they own the ACCESS_COMMENT permission in zikula

general:
- if you are using the file upload possibility of pagemaster
  there will be thumbnails created by the Thumbnail module.
  The Thumbnail module needs at least the permission
  ACCESS_EDIT to create Thumbnails. So - do not forget to
  give this permission to the user group that should be able
  to upload image files.
