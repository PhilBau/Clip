    Maxlenght more clean solution. Exclude some default plugins?
    rework the vars disposition in the templates (wrapped in proper arrays)
    new admin screen to validate the data integrity (only one online revision, title field, etc)
    integrate styles to workflow actions, like images and News buttons styles

    text plugins configurable cols, nl2br if scribite is not enabled?
    category based plugins should validate if their categories are not in the current plugin tree

    dedicated screen (or parameter) to review the own publications + revisions

    check if the pagers are generated when no publications present

    check if it's needed to exclude already linked pubs on many to one

    check if the Plugin's domain set is still needed
