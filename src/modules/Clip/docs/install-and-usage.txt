  INSTALL
    Install Clip as any other module:
    Copy its files inside the /modules folder.

    Go to your Modules Admin Panel and regenerate the list,
    install, activate and configure the writable folder path
    that Clip will use when need to upload files to the site,
    and that's all, begin the creation of your publication types
    and manage your stuff ;-)

  TO-KNOW
    Some things you should know for using Clip:

    Workflow: "none":
    * All users can add new publications to the publication type
      if they own the ACCESS_COMMENT permission in Zikula

    General:
    * If you are using the file upload possibility of Clip
      there will be thumbnails created by the Thumbnail module.
      The Thumbnail module needs at least the permission
      ACCESS_EDIT to create Thumbnails. So, do not forget to
      give this permission to the user group that should be able
      to upload image files.

  Enjoy!
