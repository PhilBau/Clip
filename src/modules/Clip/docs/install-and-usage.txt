  INSTALL
    Install Clip is pretty easy:
    Copy its files inside the /modules folder.
    Optionally, create a writable folder as ztemp/ClipModels,
    Clip will try to create it automatically if it doesn't exists.

    Go to your Modules Admin Panel and click the install icon.
    Configure the path where you want to upload files and images.
    That's all! begin the creation of your publication types
    and manage your stuff ;-)
